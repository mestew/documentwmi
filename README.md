# DocumentWMI

**DocumentWMI** is a project to help create and maintain developer reference content for 
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes, properties, and methods. 
It originated as a Microsoft hackathon project for the **Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager** 
WMI SDK reference content from the _root\ccm_ and _root\sms_ WMI namespaces. For those namespaces, 
this tool can generate over 2000 markdown files for the available classes and methods.

DocumentWMI is a PowerShell module that includes two cmdlets:

- **New-WmiHelp**: Create markdown files for a given WMI namespace.
- **New-WmiHelpToc**: Create a table of contents for those markdown files.

The module also includes help documentation with usage information. For more information on how to use these cmdlets, after you install the module, use the **Get-Help** cmdlet. For markdown versions of the help documentation, see [DocumentWMI module](./docs/DocumentWMI.md).

## How to install

First fork and clone this repository, or download the module files to a local folder. Then use the following sample PowerShell script to install and import it:

```powershell
$sourcePath = 'C:\git\documentwmi\module'
$modules = "$($Env:ProgramFiles)\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\"
$modulePath = New-Item -Path ( $modules + 'DocumentWMI' ) -ItemType Directory
Copy-Item -Path ( $sourcePath + '\*' ) -Destination $modulePath
Import-Module -Name DocumentWMI
```
